# using the ropsten-kovan test-bridge

a test-bridge is deployed between ropsten and kovan.

ropsten: `HomeBridge` contract at [0xDf40eFE7BCFae751b47D4dBe26Ed457fa335cbFe](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xDf40eFE7BCFae751b47D4dBe26Ed457fa335cbFe)

kovan: `ForeignBridge` contract at [0xc62BC10aBD17DD94f94E931e815DE7aFEa48ec54](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0xc62BC10aBD17DD94f94E931e815DE7aFEa48ec54)
which is an [ERC20-token](https://kovan.etherscan.io/token/0xc62BC10aBD17DD94f94E931e815DE7aFEa48ec54).

this guide assumes you use [metamask](https://metamask.io/)
and that in metamask you have three accounts `address1`, `address2` and `address3` which initially have 0 ether on ropsten and kovan.

in this guide you will:

1. use the bridge to transfer ropsten ether into ERC20 tokens on kovan
2. transfer those tokens around on kovan
3. use the bridge to transfer tokens on kovan back into ether on ropsten

before playing around with the bridge you need some test ether on both testnets.

## getting ropsten test ether for `address1`

in metamask set network to `ropsten` and choose `address1`

visit https://faucet.metamask.io/

click `request 1 ether from faucet`

after a couple of seconds your ether should show up in metamask

## getting kovan test ether for `address1`

post `address2` (not `address1`) in https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet.

usually within a couple of minutes someone will respond with the hash of
a transaction that sends kovan test ether to `address2`

## ropsten ether -> kovan tokens

choose `ropsten` and `account1` in metamask.

send `0.1` ether (`100000000000000000` wei) to the `HomeBridge`
contract at `0xDf40eFE7BCFae751b47D4dBe26Ed457fa335cbFe`

the transaction should show up on
https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xDf40eFE7BCFae751b47D4dBe26Ed457fa335cbFe

[what if the transaction is reverted?](troubleshooting_guide.md)

*the bridge is now relaying the deposit to kovan*

after ~1 minute a transaction should show up on
https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0xc62BC10aBD17DD94f94E931e815DE7aFEa48ec54

it should also show up here:
https://bridge-dashboard.parity.io/deposits

## check your token balance on kovan

https://kovan.etherscan.io/token/0xc62BC10aBD17DD94f94E931e815DE7aFEa48ec54#balances

your `address1` should show up as a token holder holding `0.1`

[what if i don't see it?](troubleshooting_guide.md)
