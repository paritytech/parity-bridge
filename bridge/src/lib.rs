//! the `parity-bridge` executable in `cli/src/main.rs` creates a
//! `Bridge` instance, which is a `Stream`, and then endlessly polls it,
//! thereby running the bridge.
//!
//! the `Bridge` instance internally polls three `RelayStream`s.
//! these correspond to the three relay operations a bridge node is responsible for:
//!
//! 1. `MainToSideSign`: signing off on messages from `main` to `side`. currently that means executing `sideContract.deposit` for every `mainContract.Deposit` event.
//! 2. `SideToMainSign`: signing off on messages from `side` to `main`. currently that means executing `sideContract.submitSignature` for every `sideContract.Withdraw` event.
//! 3. `SideToMainSignatures`: submitting the bundle of signatures collected on `side` through `SideToMainSign` to `main`. currently that means executing `mainContract.withdraw` for every `sideContract.CollectedSignatures` event.
//!
//! a `RelayStream` is logic that's common to the three relay operations.
//! it takes a `Stream` of logs and a `LogToFuture` that maps logs to `Futures`.
//! those futures are supposed to each do one single complete relay
//! (1. `MainToSideSign`, 2. `SideToMainSign`, 3. `SideToMainSignatures`).
//! `RelayStream` polls the log stream, calls `LogToFuture.log_to_future` for each log,
//! and yields the numbers of those blocks for which all such created futures
//! have completed. these block numbers are then persisted
//! so the bridge doesn't have to check logs up to them again next time it's started.
//!
//! a `Bridge` instance is constructed as follows (how the parts fit together):
//!
//! - a tokio `event_loop` is created.
//! - `main_transport` and `side_transport` which are web3 http transports
//!   are created and each use an `event_loop` handle
//! - the initial `state` is read from the database file
//! - the `config` is read from the config file
//! - `main_contract` (`side_contract`) which is for interaction with the main (side) bridge contract
//!   is created from `main_transport` (`side_transport`), `config` and `state`
//! - the `Bridge` instance is created from the two contracts and `state`
//!   - retrieves log streams for the three events to watch
//!   - creates the three `RelayStream`s described above
//!
//! when the `Bridge` instance is polled:
//!
//! - it polls the three `RelayStream`s
//! - each `RelayStream` polls all relay futures that are currently running as well as the log
//! stream
//! - if the log stream yields a log the relay stream creates the corresponding relay future
//! - the relay future is responsible for the entire relay operation
//! - currently relay futures check whether the specific relay has already happened,
//!   ignore if it has and execute the corresponding transaction otherwise
//! - relay futures should (currently don't) and easily could observe whether
//!   the transaction succeeds, log it to help with troubleshooting and
//!   retry if the condition can be recovered from
